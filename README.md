The goal of this report is to analyze and implement a trend indicator methodology based on exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA). This indicator is derived from a referenced methodology and is designed to dynamically assess market trends based on historical price data. The implementation and analysis include:

* Dynamic trend detection.
* Visualization of price trends with color-coded segments.
* Application of the methodology using Python.
* Backtesting a trading strategy based on the indicator.

The implementation is referenced from the document titled "Trend Indicator Methodology," which outlines the mathematical foundation and parameters for the trend indicator.
